                    <br> Their song is a welcome sound in mainland forests that otherwise may have little native bird song.
                    <br> Although they have a brush-like tongue which is used to reach deeply into flowers to reach nectar, bellbirds
                    also feed on fruits and insects.
                    <br> In feeding on nectar they play an important ecological role in pollinating the flowers of many native
                    trees and shrubs.
                    <br> Subsequently, when feeding on the fruits that result from this pollination they have a role in dispersing
                    the seeds, and so they assist in the regeneration of the forest in at least two ways.</td>

                    <br> Its wide distribution and habitat preferences, including frequenting well-treed urban parks and gardens,
                    means that most people encounter fantails occasionally.
                    <br> They can be quite confiding, continuing to nest build or visit their nestlings with food when people
                    watch quietly.
                    <br> There are two colour forms or ‘morphs’ of fantail, with the more common pied morph occurring throughout
                    its range, and the black morph comprising up to 5% of the South Island population, and occasionally occurring

                    <br> It vies with rifleman for the title of New Zealand’s smallest bird, with both weighing about 6 g.

                    <br> Innately curious, kea are attracted to people wherever they enter its mountain domain, and are a feature
                    at South Island ski-fields and mountain huts.
                    <br> Their attraction to people and their paraphernalia is a two-edged sword, providing both new threats
